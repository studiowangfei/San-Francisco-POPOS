# San Francisco POPOS
An UX (Urban Experience) project on San Francisco POPOS (privately owned public space)

POPOS stands for Privately Owned Public Open Space. San Francisco City currently owns over 70 POPOS and people usually go to them to enjoy their lunch. Other than its environmental design, another important parameter that decides a POPOS' popularity is its sunlight condition during 11:00 to 14:00 every weekday. This project designs a data visualization that maps out all San Francisco POPOS' locations and their shadow conditions at 11:00, 12:00, 13:00 and 14:00. People can use this real-time map to choose the POPOS they want to visit based on its location, rating, sunshine/shadow and quality etc. 

This project is currently under development with Google Maps APIs.
